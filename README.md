The Destination Reservation System is a full-stack web application that allows users to register and book travel destinations online. It simplifies the manual booking process by providing an automated, user-friendly interface for travelers.

This system is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL for the back-end. It demonstrates seamless data flow from client to server and secure storage in a relational database.
